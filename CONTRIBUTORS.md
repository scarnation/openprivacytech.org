Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific! Follow the stipulated issue Guidelines 
Give sample code if you can. 
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

Use a Consistent Coding Style and Be open to sharing insights 


spaces for indentation rather than tabs would be preferable
